Getting an API key
------------------

### Paid Method

Visit the [IP1 SMS Shop](https://shop.ip1sms.com/#!/cart) and add an SMS balance or service of your choice and then proceed to checkout. Create an account at the  under Customer information. When done click ``Pay by Card`` and pay for chosen balance or service. An email has by this point been sent to you with login and API credentials. The ones you're interested in for using the API are Account ID and API Key.

### Free Method

Create a free test-account at:
[app.ip1sms.com](https://app.ip1sms.com/account/signup)

Then log in [here](https://app.ip1sms.com/login/) using the credentials sent to the phone number provided via SMS. Once logged in go on to [this page](https://app.ip1sms.com/settings/#api) in order to get your API credentials.

All set
--------

Now you got all credentials you need to start using our APIs. How to authenticate differs between the different APIs but they all use the same API keys.
Navigate to the API of your choice to get the authentication details for that API.
