REST API
-------

Modern RESTful API, easily accessible by any system that can make proper HTTP requests using JSON formatting. It gives you access to most of our services directly in your own applications with minimal work.

Basic use-cases include contact management, SMS message reminders, notifications and communication.

Our premium services such as AnalysSMS are also available through API, with an added cost. With this you can have your application automatically send surveys and collect answers when needed. This API uses `HTTP Basic Authentication` for authentication.
