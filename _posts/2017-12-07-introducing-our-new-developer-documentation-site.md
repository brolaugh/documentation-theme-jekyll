For quite some time we've felt that the developer documentation on our site wasn't enough. Our REST API's auto generated documentation was sort of iffy for newcomers as it was more or less a JSON schema spec with bad data as examples such as `sample string 3` as example string instead a real world value. Going forward this site will make it possible for us to strucure the documentation how we want instead of being constrained by the overhead and headaches created by trying to edit the `Help Pages for ASP.NET Web API`.

The old documentation won't get removed any time soon, although we will start adding links to this site whenever we feel the auto generated documentation is insufficient. If you dare to check it out have a look at [here](http://api.ip1sms.com/Help)!

Anyhow.

Welcome to iP.1's new Developer Documentation site!
